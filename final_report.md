### WHERE DO PEOPLE GET NEWS THAT THEY TRUST ABOUT POLITICS AND INNER GROUP CONFLICT?



## Abstract

     This study explores how information networks influence media consumption, political perceptions, and intergroup dynamics, with a specific focus on rural 
  and urban communities in Africa. Using data from the Afrobarometer dataset, the research identifies key differences in media consumption patterns. Urban 
  respondents are more likely to engage with social media, while rural respondents rely more on newspapers and discussions with family and friends. These differences 
  highlight the role of settlement type in shaping how people access and interpret information. Drawing on concepts like Carlson’s "distorted democracy" and Rogers’ theory 
  of media marginalization, the study reveals how socially transmitted information reinforces in-group and out-group biases. The findings emphasize the need for media literacy 
  programs and equitable access to reliable information, particularly in rural areas where information networks may play a larger role. The study concludes by calling for further 
  analysis of sociological factors, such as GDP, democracy, and political affiliation, to better understand how media consumption shapes political behavior and social cohesion.
