### WHERE DO PEOPLE GET NEWS THAT THEY TRUST ABOUT POLITICS AND INNER GROUP CONFLICT?



## Abstract

This study explores how information networks influence media consumption, political perceptions, and intergroup dynamics, with a specific focus on rural and urban communities in   Africa. Using data from the Afrobarometer dataset, the research identifies key differences in media consumption patterns. Urban respondents are more likely to engage with social media, while rural respondents rely more on newspapers and discussions with family and friends. These differences highlight the role of settlement type in shaping how people access and interpret information. Drawing on concepts like Carlson’s "distorted democracy" and Rogers’ theory of media marginalization, the study reveals how socially transmitted information reinforces in-group and out-group biases. The findings emphasize the need for media literacy programs and equitable access to reliable information, particularly in rural areas where information networks may play a larger role. The study concludes by calling for further analysis of sociological factors, such as GDP, democracy, and political affiliation, to better understand how media consumption shapes political behavior and social cohesion.


## Literature Review

News or information sharing is an activity that is performed on an everyday basis. Throughout the entire world, there are a number of information sharing networks that serve to spread information, or potentially misinformation, to members in their communities. With information sharing comes communication of said information. Communication is a major component of what allows groups to survive in their societies. It allows them to learn more about their own communities and those that govern them(Carlson 2024). With the advent of social media, this process is even better facilitated as it allows for easier access to a myriad of news: it permits its users to search and consume political information posted by users that obtain their views from other networks (Johnson and Kaye 2014). This type of information can provide people with the options to accept these new perspectives, reinforce existing values, or ignore the information altogether (Johnson and Kaye 2014). A major question surrounding this project is how people make these decisions. The objective is to understand how people trust certain information that they receive and how this varies in a number of different communities and perspectives. 

One of the ways in which information is trusted or vetted by others is through socially transmitted information.  This can occur especially with social media as it’s a term that describes information communicated by others in online and face-to-face conversations (Carlson 2024). This is explained in “Through the Grapevine” where Taylor Carlson recounts events in recent American history where the release of misinformation can lead to its further amplification. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, USA-Today had released a tweet saying that “The United States, the only country to record anywhere near 1 million cases of the coronavirus, has reached another somber milestone”, immediately following this statement with a graphic depiction of deaths caused by COVID-19. Despite the information being accurate, it was also met with many replies by users who viewed the situation in a different light. One of the users replied to the tweet saying that, proportionally, one million is less than one percent of the population and that the U.S had more accurate numbers due to testing a higher percentage of their population compared to other highly populated countries such as India and China (Carlson 2024). As a result of this socially transmitted information posted by this user, the information begins to paint a different picture, in which the virus is being downplayed or called a “hoax”. Even in the face of curated information, this example demonstrates how someone can create a narrative to fit their deeply opinionated mind.  As a result, there will also be others that seek out to bolster their trust in their existing opinions by aligning with those that share their beliefs. All of this is caused by what Carlson describes as a “distorted democracy”.

Chapter one of “Through the Grapevine”, “How Political Conversations Change the Information Environment” lays down the potential effects that arise as a result of the trickling down of information from media professionals to versions delivered to common people by word-of-mouth. She argues that learning through this “grapevine” creates a distorted democracy which is marked by “an under informed, polarized, but engaged public, driven by changes to the information environment created by members of the public(Carlson 2024). The distortion of information typically occurs during “social transmission”, where the information becomes distorted with the bias of the information holder.  This all stems from a concept Carlson referenced called the “two-step flow”, where the actively informed share information to the casually informed. In accordance with their names, the actively informed seek out more political media and are more engaged than the casually informed. However, it’s important to mention that the actively informed does not simply recount the information that they have consumed to the casual. According to Carlson, the actively informed “packages” this information in a way that fits their political views, therefore creating a funnel of distorted information to be spread from person to person. Word-to-mouth is a very powerful tool for enabling distorted democracy as it is often given from whom the recipient would describe as a trusted individual. According to Carlson, nearly 35 percent of those who are labeled as casually informed report getting information from family “most of the time”, on the other hand, 5 percent report getting information from strangers(Carlson 2024). Given some of the survey results, socially transmitted information is the driver of this distorted democracy. However, it is difficult to measure the extent to which information is being transmitted through word-to-mouth. Even though data is present that displays its effect, discovering the type of diction, tone, and overall presentation of the information from person to person would require a much more legitimate, word-for-word account of these dynamics.

Outside of common word-of-mouth deliverances of information is the transfer of information that occurs through social media and the online world. In “Marginalizing the Mainstream: How Social Media Privilege Political Information”, Richard Rogers grapples with the level of uncertainty online, questioning how problematic information manifests itself in online social media platforms. In order to determine the role that social media plays, Rogers analyzes the misinformation problem leading up to the 2020 election in a multi-platform perspective. According to Rogers, information can be marginalized in several different ways depending on the type of social media platform. For example, Roger states that the popular media platform TikTok parodies mainstream media whereas platforms such as 4chan and Reddit would “dismiss it and direct users to alternative influencer networks and extreme YouTube content”(Rogers 2021). Furthermore, social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook tend to point to hyperpartisan or “Fake News” sources”. Finally, instagram appeared to contain the most earnest content in relation to the election, which was primarily shared by influencers instead of experts(Rogers 2021). Rogers claims that all of this creates an echo chamber that prevents users from accessing “accurate, nuanced perspectives”(Rogers 2021). These examples highlight the reinforcement in bias that is present in these social media platforms as prejudiced individuals typically prefer news that reinforce their values and avoid those that challenge them (Arendt). Rogers found that TikTok users strived to use Trump and Biden hashtags to maximize views and engagement, straying from commitment to a position. However, in videos that proved to show commitment(to a candidate), we observe more sarcastic videos(lacking substance) targeting the common pitfalls of each candidate. This mostly comes in the form of videos targeting Biden’s age or those that brand Trump supporters as racist and misogynist (Rogers 2021).  Regardless of the validity of claims made by users, the format of videos and content on platforms like TikTok are bound to marginalize mainstream media information. This process works similarly to the distorted democracy except that creators on TikTok are incentivized to create engaging content by catering to supporters that align with their views. In order to facilitate this process, it’s easier to take information from mainstream media and transform it in a way that will be easily digestible for audience members that enjoy this form of content. Fortunately for these creators, TikTok is the perfect place to achieve this.

Varying media forms also demonstrate a capacity to influence the thoughts and belief systems of different communities, nationalities, and other affiliations. A study from the University of Akron titled “Media Consumption, Perceptions of Crime Risk and Fear of Crime: Examining Race/Ethnic Differences” compares different media types and analyzes their effect on different races' perception or fear of crime. Callanan mentions how previous studies on the effect of media influencing one’s perception of reality normally focus on the effect on one’s fear of crime. However, these studies would focus on groups such as “victims and non-victims”, “residents of high-crime areas and those of low-crime areas”, “men and women”, and much more (Callanan 2012). Thus Callanan measured the fear of crime present in White, Latino, and Black people while also measuring an “intervening variable” which was the “Likelihood of Neighborhood Crime Risk. Additional factors were considered such as household income, education, and a scale measuring the frequency of them being a victim of a crime. The results revealed that television news and crime-based reality shows have more impact on both perception of neighborhood crime and fear of crime than do newspapers or crime dramas (Callanan 2012). In the topic of race, even though the results were equivalent regarding fear of crime and consumption of local television news, Callanan doesn’t shy from the different “cognitive processing”. Where for example, a white viewer may substitute themselves as a victim, fearing the possibility of the event happening to them.  Whereas a black viewer who lives in a high percentage black neighborhood would feel more “resonance”, knowing that the depictions of crime on tv match with their reality. This is largely, in part, due to the fact that non-whites in this study are more likely to live in poorer communities with higher rates of crime due to having a lower average income (Callanan 2012). Callanan’s research is pivotal as it allows for readers to understand how different forms of media speak to audiences of varying backgrounds in the United States. Not only does it focus on what the media transmits to its viewers, but how the viewers’ environment and circumstances affect their interpretation of the events. This underscores the intersectionality of identity that is considered in the trusting and vetting of information. Although these results are promising, it does however lack a potential view of how other Races perceive each other as a result of consuming these different forms of media.

Including groups like race, it can be observed that the development of social groups and social categorizations leads to higher levels of distrust and more bias towards outgroups. Social identity theory derives from the premise “that human beings are, by nature, a pattern recognition species and that the human ability to distinguish between objects, circumstances, and behavior is a functional cognitive process necessary for survival”(Cuhadar and Bayton). In accordance with this theory is the establishment of in-groups and out-groups that are created by members of a specific community.  In-groups are usually formed surrounding common identities shared within the group whereas outgroups are groups who share an identity that differs from the ingroups(Cuhadar and Dayton 2011). There are major barriers that come to creation during in-group and outgroup dynamics. One of the psychological barriers that Kramer describes to be of influence in intergroup conflicts is the response to different types of behavior or strategy with one’s own judgment. For instance, Kramer references an anecdote from World War 2 when the Japanese had planned to attack Pearl Harbor. During the time, an informant for the United States was sure that the Japanese were not planning to attack because there were groups of sailors that were walking around Tokyo. However, it was later revealed that the sailors were part of the Japanese military and were a ploy to distract watchers while the army had prepared its attack on Pearl Harbor(Kramer).  The in-group, Japan, in this situation was able to outsmart the United States due to the United States’ high level of distrust of Japan. Inversely, we can say that the level of trust that is present in the Japanese army allowed the forces to create a plan that only they would be able to understand in order to outwit the United States. However, what is most important to acknowledge is the trust that the United States army held with the informant. Since the informant belongs to the in-group, his word regarding out-group activities are unquestionably vetted. This relates to the idea of how in-group members are very likely to behave with preference within their group in order to protect their self esteem and achieve a “positive and distinct social identity”(Ramiah 2011). If United States soldiers had questioned the informant’s judgment, it would mean potentially questioning his loyalty to the country. Instead, the soldiers would prefer to trust a member of their in-group instead of clashing with them, maintaining their self esteem as a member of the in-group.

All in all, information can inhabit a number of forms to create trust within communities and different groups. At the time of research, it appears that there is not a sufficient amount of literature available supporting the specific ways in which information is generally trusted in continents outside of North America. It would be plausible to analyze different international ongoing conflicts and the behavior of different ethnic groups across many states, however, this would also be limiting in its failure to generalize ways in which this process is done in these continents. Although there isn’t a focus on specific topics, Jiang and Zhang have found that education and perceptions of government corruption affect the level of political trust in Asia. They claim that the more educated are likely to have more distrust for the government. They also continue to claim that those who believe the government is “prevalent” are more likely to trust the government than those who don’t (Jiang and Zhang 2021). Furthermore, in the context of intergroup conflict and trust, the British Journal of Political Science published a paper that hypothesized that ethnic diversity is positively related to ethnocentric trust(described as trust varying by ethnicity, meaning that there may be a difference in trust for those of the same ethnicity and those of different ethnicities) across countries but negatively related to ethnocentric trust within countries (Robinson 2020). However, the study later found their results to be contradictory through the use of data from Malawi(measure of ethnocentric trust within a country)  and sixteen other countries(measure of ethnocentric trust across countries). They found that ethnocentric diversity actually leads to less ethnocentric trust. (Robinson 2020). These findings are interesting as they may open the door for further analysis on how a number of different social factors(GDP, democracy, etc) come into play in the trust of information and intergroup conflict.


## Results

The following visualizations highlight the usage of several media types in rural and urban locations throughout the continent of Africa. These findings demonstrate that survey participants inhabiting rural areas are more likely to have a lower frequency of respondents that have a high usage of social media whereas the inverse relationship is the case for respondents inhabiting urban areas. Furthermore, we can observe that there is a more positive relationship between respondents from urban and rural locations for consumption of news from friends and family(this question differs slightly from the others as it asks the respondent how often they discuss political matters with friends and family). Despite a high level of respondents claiming to never consume news from friends, we can observe similar patterns in frequencies between rural and urban inhabitants with “Occasionally” consuming news from friends and family containing the highest frequency for both location types. The positive relationship between rural and urban respondents is also present in newspaper consumption, where the highest number of respondents for both location types are contained in the “Never” category, followed by significantly lower frequencies of respondents that consume newspapers at any level. Finally, rural and urban respondents seem to mirror each other for levels of television consumption marked “Occasionally” until we reach the extremes of consumption, implying a much larger margin between respondents that never consume television(higher frequency in rural areas) and for respondents that consume television every day(higher frequency in urban areas). All in all, there’s more domination in consumption of social media by urban respondents as well as more dominance observed by rural respondents in newspaper consumption. In addition, news consumption from family and friends contain similar levels of consumption between rural and urban respondents. Finally, television consumption from both rural and urban respondents possess an inverse relationship.

All in all, there’s more domination in consumption of social media by urban respondents as well as more dominance observed by rural respondents in newspaper consumption. In addition, news consumption from family and friends contain similar levels of consumption between rural and urban respondents. Finally, television consumption from both rural and urban respondents possess an inverse relationship. These findings may be useful for those who are interested in understanding where Africans prefer to consume their news. 


### Heatmap Visualizations



The following heat maps make way for more analysis on the correlation between rural and urban respondents, specifically for Question 9 related to political discussion amongst friends and family, as well as Question 55 related to frequency of information obtained through social media mediums. The most notable observations on the heat maps are the similar levels of frequency of political discussion for both urban and rural respondents implying that the regularity of political discussion does not make a difference whether or not you inhabit a rural or urban area. On the other hand, there seems to be much more of a difference in how often rural and urban respondents obtain their news from social media. We can observe that 19.7% of urban respondents “frequently” get their news from social media compared to 8.47% of rural respondents. Furthermore, the rural settlement type has a much higher percentage of respondents that claim to never obtain their news from social media, accounting for about 39% of respondents compared to the urban settlement type’s 16.7% percent. This overall suggests that urban respondents are more exposed to news on social media compared to rural respondents.


<img width="1400" height="865" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e31dce33-fe06-46b1-9a0c-0d16643df017" />

Finally, we decided to analyze Question 68 which asks respondents to declare which statement better aligns with their view on diversity.
Statement 1: Communities are stronger when they are made up of people from different ethnic groups, races, or religions.
Statement 2: Communities are stronger when they are made up of people who are similar to each other, that is, people from the same ethnic group, race, or religion. 



<img width="1400" height="865" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c50834e-f74f-4808-907b-1095e43753db" />





Based on the results, it may seem that, initially, there is more belief in the positive effects of diversity within communities in rural settlement types. However, due to there being more rural respondents than urban(54.86% being rural compared to 45.14% being urban), it’s important to take the proportion of responses for both settlement types. Out of the 45.14% of urban respondents, 31.99% claim diverse communities are stronger compared to 37.49% of 54.86% of rural respondents, resulting in the percentage of those who believe they’re stronger  as 70.87% and 68.3 respectively. This reveals that there is a slight difference in favor of urban respondents, stating that urban respondents champion diversity communities compared to rural respondents. 




### CONCLUSION


Information networks play a vital role in shaping the values, beliefs, and perceptions of people worldwide. This research sought to understand how these networks influence media consumption and perceptions of in-groups and out-groups. By analyzing data from the Afrobarometer dataset, we identified key differences in how rural and urban communities in Africa engage with news media. Urban respondents were more likely to consume news through social media, while rural respondents relied more on newspapers and discussions with family and friends. These patterns illustrate how settlement type influences engagement with information networks, offering insight into how different communities access and interpret media. 
A key finding of this study is the role of socially transmitted information in reinforcing in-group and out-group dynamics. This concept aligns with Carlson’s "distorted democracy" framework, which describes how actively informed individuals influence the views of casually informed individuals. Our analysis revealed that both rural and urban respondents rely heavily on discussions with family and friends as a major source of news. Since these exchanges are shaped by the perspectives of the senders, the process often amplifies existing biases within social groups. These findings suggest that in-group preferences are perpetuated by social transmission, which may influence how communities view outsiders and how social conflicts emerge. These findings carry important implications for policymakers, media practitioners, and educators. Efforts to increase access to diverse, reliable news in rural areas could bridge the information gap between rural and urban communities. I believe that future research should investigate how sociological factors like GDP, democracy, and political affiliation affect media consumption and trust in information. Countries with higher GDPs may have greater access to technology, potentially widening the information gap between rural and urban areas. Similarly, democratic institutions often support press freedom, which may lead to broader access to diverse perspectives. Examining how these factors impact citizens’ media habits could offer a deeper understanding of how political and economic conditions shape public engagement with media. 
In conclusion, this research highlights the powerful role of information networks in shaping public perception and intergroup dynamics. By examining media consumption in Africa, we identified settlement type as a crucial factor influencing how people engage with information. Urban respondents had greater access to social media, while rural respondents relied more on newspapers and social interactions. These differences emphasize the need for equitable access to information and media literacy initiatives. Future research could explore additional sociological factors to better understand how media, politics, and group identity intersect. By addressing these gaps, policymakers, educators, and media practitioners can help create more informed, inclusive, and connected societies.
