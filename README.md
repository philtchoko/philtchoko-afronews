# Where Do People Get News That They Trust About Politics and Inner-Group Conflict?
  
  
  
  This study explores how information networks influence media consumption, political perceptions, and intergroup dynamics, with a specific focus on rural and urban communities in Africa.
Using data from the Afrobarometer dataset, the research identifies key differences in media consumption patterns. Urban respondents are more likely to engage with social media, while rural 
respondents rely more on newspapers and discussions with family and friends. These differences highlight the role of settlement type in shaping how people access and interpret information. 
Drawing on concepts like Carlson’s "distorted democracy" and Rogers’ theory of media marginalization, the study reveals how socially transmitted information reinforces in-group and out-group 
biases. The findings emphasize the need for media literacy programs and equitable access to reliable information, particularly in rural areas where information networks may play a larger role. 
The study concludes by calling for further analysis of sociological factors, such as GDP, democracy, and political affiliation, to better understand how media consumption shapes political 
behavior and social cohesion.
